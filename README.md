# SORTING

This repository contains C++ programs on sorting. It includes selection sort and bubble sort.

**SELECTION SORT**
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of an array and moving it to the beginning. 
The algorithm divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. In each iteration, it finds the smallest element in the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element 
of the unsorted region. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

**BUBBLE SORT**
Bubble sort is another simple sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted. It's called "bubble sort" because the larger elements "bubble" to the 
end of the array in each pass.

## Program List

- **Selection Sort:** A program where the elements of an array have been used using selection sort.
- **Bubble Sort:** A program where the elements of an array have been used using bubble sort.
